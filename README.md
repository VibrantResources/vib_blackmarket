# blackmarket
Black market resource for illegal sales and crafting

# DEPENDENCIES

- QBCore
- ox_lib
- ox_inventory
- ox_target
- scully_emotemenu

# General information

We've made the hacking part of this resource use a client side cooldown as oppopsed to a server cooldown to give all players the chance at entering within a reasonable amount of time

The kidnap ped is there so other players see you being taken away, otherwise it'd just be a standard teleport and that's boring

# To-do

- Finish animations on all interactions and hacks
- Finish all context menu details (Anims/Images etc)
- Tidy up all debug options
- Improve ped spawn threads
- Update variable names for clearer understanding
